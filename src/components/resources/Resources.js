  <h2>Portland Parks and Rec</h2>
  <img alt='parksRecLogo' src='https://i2.wp.com/star-news.info/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/portland_parks_and_rec.jpg' />
  <p>The mission of Portland Parks and Recreation is to help Portlanders play - providing the safe places, facilities, and programs which promote physical, mental, and social activity. We get people, especially kids, outside, active, and connected to the community. As we do this, there will be an increase in the wellness of our residents and the livability of our city. </p>
  <h2>Saturday Academy</h2>
  <img alt='SaturdayAcademy' src='https://www.guidestar.org/ViewEdoc.aspx?eDocId=4002307&approved=True' />
  <p>Saturday Academy strives to engage all motivated young people, including those from under-represented communities, in hands-on, in-depth learning by connecting them to community experts as educators and mentors. Our vision is that all interested, pre-college students in our region will have the opportunity to interact with community experts and experience professional environments in ways that assist them in developing intellectually and preparing for rewarding careers. Saturday Academys innovative programs are open to all students in grades 2 through 12. We value all learning, and offer experiences in many disciplines. We emphasize science, technology, engineering and math (STEM), because these fields are critical for childrens careers and their fast pace of change is difficult to address in traditional school settings. Saturday Academy was founded in 1983, and became an independent 501c3 nonprofit in 2006. Saturday Academy has provided instruction to more than 185,000 students throughout Oregon and SW Washington.</p>
  <h2>Non Profit Organizations:</h2>
  <h2>Potluck in the Park</h2>
  <img alt='Potluckparklogo' src='https://www.potluckinthepark.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/PotluckLogo-Winter27-color-e1543860344973.png' />
  <p>Rain or shine, 52 weeks a year, hundreds of needy people have a hot meal and a community gathering place because generous supporters like you. Understanding food is a human right and hunger is a human wrong. Every Sunday for twenty-five years Potluck in the Park volunteers have prepared and served healthy wholesome meals with dignity and kindness. The secret to Potluck in the Park’s staying power is the story of its people.  Our tenacious teams of career-volunteers have inspired thousands of other volunteers to donate their time, talent and money to fight hunger in Portland.  Their dedication and passion has made Potluck in the Park a touchstone for a community in crisis. </p>
  <h2>SMART</h2>
  <img alt='smartlogo' src='http://www.volunteercentraloregon.org/content/www.volunteercentraloregon.org/agency/14290.jpg?1498602763'/>
  <p>Learning to read is one of the most important steps in a child’s life, laying the vital foundation for future knowledge and education. Research proves that shared book reading and access to books in the home during a child’s first, formative years are the strongest predictors of early literacy skills. At SMART, this is what we do.</p>
  <h2>Childrens Book Bank</h2>
  <img alt='bookbanklogo' src='https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/1042249256143282176/c83836XL_400x400.jpg' />  
  <p>The Children’s Book Bank began when Founder and Executive Director Danielle Swope decided to find a way to give the stacks of books her children had outgrown.  Inspired by her own experiences as a Teach for America teacher and a parent, Dani wanted to ensure that her children’s books got into the hands of kids who might not otherwise have books of their own at home.  She contacted a local Head Start program that was happy to receive her family’s books and took her kids on a field trip to deliver them.  Within a week her phone was ringing off the hook with people looking for the “Book Lady” and asking to sign up for her “program.”  Clearly, the community had a need for books!  After a few pilot book drives, it became clear that the community ALSO had a supply of books to give.  The missing piece was a sustainable system to get the books off shelves and into the hands and homes of kids in need.  The Children’s Book Bank was created to fill that void by engaging the community in collecting, sorting, and distributing donated children’s books. </p>
  <h2>Ronald McDonald House</h2>
  <img alt='ronaldmclogo' src='https://rmhcoregon.amz2.securityserve.com/wp-content/uploads/RMHC_Chapter_Logo_2018.jpg' />
  <p>Every year, thousands of families travel to Portland and Bend to get the best medical care possible for their seriously ill or injured child. And for more than 30 years, our Ronald McDonald Houses® have offered these families comfort, support, and a beautiful place to stay just moments away from their child’s bedside. Last year we welcomed 1,825 families for a total of 17,917 nights at our three Oregon Houses, hosting 2,861 children across the state. And since opening our doors, we have provided a “home away from home” for more than 35,000 families.</p>
  <h2>Mother and Child Education Center</h2>
  <img alt='motherchildcenter' src='https://mark.trademarkia.com/logo-images/mother--child-education-center/mother--child-education-center-77677534.jpg' />
  <p>We will provide a safe gathering place. We will work to remove barriers of language, culture, or custom so that all know they are welcome. Our services will be free. We will not require ID. [Except for Proof of Pregnancy.] We will not restrict services to income level or demographic. We will creatively assist each parent before, during, and after pregnancy so she can confidently nurture her child. We will offer parents practical help: resources, supplies, referrals, mentoring, and learning opportunities.</p>
  <h2>Store to Door</h2>
  <img alt='storetodoor' src='https://static1.squarespace.com/static/57682b63d2b857e786bb1ec7/t/59dd1afb2278e7c9307e797a/1508798662120/Store+to+Door+Logo.jpg'/>
  <p>Store to Door supports independent living for Portland area seniors and people with disabilities by providing an affordable, personal, volunteer-based grocery shopping and delivery service. We envision the Portland area to be a community where all seniors and people with disabilities are nourished, included, and can age with dignity in the setting of their own choice.</p>
  <h2>Oregon Humane Society</h2>
  <img alt='oregonhumane' src='https://www.globalgiving.org/pfil/organ/3880/orglogo.gif'/>
  <p>OHS is the largest  humane society  in the Northwest, and adopts more animals from its Portland shelter than any other single-facility shelter on the West Coast. OHS puts no time limits on how long animals remain at the shelter—a pet stays available for adoption for as long as needed to find a loving home. If a pet in the care of OHS needs medical attention, the OHS veterinary hospital provides the pet with same level of care you would want your own pet to receive. Founded in 1868 by noted humanitarian Thomas Lamb Eliot, OHS is the fourth-oldest humane society in the nation. Eliot initially established OHS to stop the neglect and abuse of draft animals. The mission expanded to include companion animals and, until 1933, orphaned children.</p>
